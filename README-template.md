### What I learned

- How to center content using CSS Grid with display: grid and place-content: center.
- Styling with pseudo-classes like :hover and :not(:last-child) for better interactivity and spacing.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.card .location{
    color: var(--PrimaryGreen);
    /* margin: .5rem 0 1.5rem; */
    margin-top: .5rem;
    margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
    font-weight: 700;
}


### Continued development

i want to continue making a few projects from frontend mentor and then make a webapp of my own.
